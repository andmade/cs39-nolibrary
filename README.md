# Ashley Davis | CSCI-E 39: "No Library, No Problem"

[Assignment Link](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/35225/assignments/201081?module_item_id=365819)

This assignment creates containers using CSS Grid corresponding to the layout for a [previous assignment](https://codepen.io/andmade/full/yvENRv/)

#Note:

The 3 ads from the whiteboard layout are a dark blue. If they're not showing up, disable your adblocker. It's probably adding "display:none" to that section because the word "ads" is in the class name. For semantic reasons, I did not feel it appropriate to change the class name. Also, blockers gonna block.
